# EmployeeTracker

This application utilized the MySQL database with node and inquirer to build a managing system for a company's employees. This interface is called CMS, content managing system. 

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

Add departments, roles, employees
View departments, roles, employees
Update employee roles

Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
